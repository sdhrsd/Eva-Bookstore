#     This code uses the SHA2 algorithm, which uses a 256 or 512 bit key, 
#     which then generates a 512 or 1024 bit block.  The longer key makes 
#     this algorithm better, as does the fact that it appears to be 
#     impervious to collisions, which makes it more resistant to hacking.  
#     This is the algorithm generally used by the US government.  
#     This algorithm is still not widely used in industry, though it should be.
